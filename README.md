# Biskuit CMS
[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/682566394222477378)](https://discord.gg/aBdqDcE)

Bis[ku]it is a modular and lightweight CMS built with Symfony components and Vue.js.

This unofficial version of Pagekit was created to solve various problems. Mainly born for linuxhub.it, a portal that uses PageKit.

This project is taking a different path from that of official pagekit. The project is called Bis[ku]it and will not be compatible with future pagekit updates.

Feel free to use it.
